# Geometry In Python
### What?
This is just practice. In my geometry class we are learning about things like circles and trig so I thought I'd apply this in the best way I know.

### What am I doing with this?
It's most likely just gonna be several scripts increasing in complexity. My first is just 5 white lines and a couple of variables, but I'd like to get to things like a spinning cube and such.

### I'm 14, give me a break
Most likely this code is gonna be trash. Maybe I'll comment a thing or two here and there, but not often. I mean I know I should, and I get mad when I have to try to make sense of code, but comments are too much work

### What can you do?
Check my math? My functions? I don't know. It's github, do what you want.
